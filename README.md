# RoadToQuant

**RoadToQuant** is a personal archive of programming projects created along my journey into quantitative finance. Each project represents a step forward — from learning programming fundamentals to tackling finance-specific challenges.

## What's Inside

- Mathematical implementations  
  Numerical methods, probability, linear algebra in code.

- Financial models  
  Option pricing, portfolio risk, asset simulation.

- Algorithmic logic  
  Backtesting frameworks, data analysis tools.

- Utility scripts  
  Performance testing, file parsing, sandbox experiments.

## Purpose

This repository documents my applied learning. It’s not about perfection — it’s about process, progress, and precision. I aim to understand the core of quantitative finance by building from scratch.

## Tools and Languages

- C++ (main programming language)
- STL and math libraries
- Git for version control

## About

My name is Johannes Meyer. I'm a South African student and founder of *Young & Calculated*.  
This repo is part of my effort to build in public, promote real learning, and create early exposure to quantitative finance for youth worldwide.
